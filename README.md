# Project Proposal Sheet: 
### Hate Crime Spike and News Correlation Analysis
## Team Members: 
Rossie Jimenez, Emanuel Diaz-Berrios and Steven Carrasquillo-Merly
 
## Scope of Research:
Review the FBI's Hate crime data explorer to identify spikes and analyze through the NYT API if there were any major headlines prior that may have led to spikes in hate crimes towards a specific group of people. 

### Tasks:
1. Clean up hate crime data.
    - Organize by bias’.
    - Organize by location.
    - Possibly look at nationwide trends.
    - Determine time frame for research.
2.	Identify spikes and new headlines timelines to research.
    - Define what we consider a major spike.
    - Look for major spikes based on bias’ and location.
    - Determine how far before a spike we’d like to search headline articles.
3. Pull News headlines.
    - Review headline articles from designated timeline
    - Search in headline for bias’ related keywords. 
    - Test spike and headline correlation for multiple instances. 
4. Determine if there is a correlation between the two
    - Can we see a spike xx days after a headline?
    - Are spikes more local or national? (City specific, state-wide or nationwide)

### Datasets: 
NYT API, FBI Hate Crime dataset(CSV), Possible other News outlet APIs.

### Hypothesis:
1. Headlines effect hate crime spikes at a nationwide level.
2. Headlines effect hate crime spikes at a local level.
3. There is no correlation between crime spikes and headlines.
